#  Object Detection + Distance Estimation for Robotics Navigation  
Your goal is to detect navigation-relevant objects and estimate how far they are from the robot (from camera perspective). On top of that, you’ll look into ways of making your model run efficiently on edge devices.  

## Objective  

- Detect **cones, barriers, stop signs**.  
- Estimate their distance from the robot (camera perspective) and annotate results accordingly.  
- Explore optimization techniques for running your model on limited hardware.

## What to Do  

### 1. Object Detection  
- Work with the [BDD100K dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solesensei/solesensei_bdd100k).  (Optional, feel free to look into any other relevant datasets.)
- Use **transfer learning** – pick a suitable pretrained model and fine-tune it.  
- Keep your implementation clean and modular.  

### 2. Distance Estimation  
- For each detected object, estimate distance to the robot.  
- Annotate bounding boxes like this:  
  ```
  Cone, 1.5m
  Stop Sign, 3.2m
  ```

### 3. Optimization for Edge Devices  
- Try out quantization, pruning, or swapping to lightweight backbones.  
- Record **FPS** on CPU and GPU for comparison.

## Optional (Extra Credit)  

Not mandatory, but good to explore if you’re curious:  
- **Epipolar Geometry** – derive disparity–depth relation.  
- **Homography / Perspective Transform** – warp the scene to a bird’s-eye view.  
- **Optical Flow** – track moving cones across frames.

## Submission and deadline
- Submit your work by committing your code to this repository within 2 days of accepting the assignment.
- Submissions made to personal repositories will not be reviewed; ensure all work is pushed to the designated repository provided for you.

## 💡 Notes  

- Transfer learning will save you time.  
- Distance estimation doesn’t need to be perfect, but it should be based on geometry (focal length, pixel size, etc.).  
- Show “before vs. after” results if you try quantization or pruning.

Good luck, and have fun blending **deep learning with geometry** for robotics!
